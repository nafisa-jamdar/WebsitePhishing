Phishing attacks pose a significant threat to online security, deceiving users into
disclosing sensitive information through fraudulent websites. Traditional detection
mechanisms, such as blacklists and heuristics, are increasingly ineffective against
sophisticated phishing tactics like domain obfuscation and cloaking. To address this
challenge, our project develops a machine learning-based phishing detection
system that analyzes website URLs and content to classify them as legitimate or
phishing.Using models like XGBoost, Random Forest, and Neural Networks, the
system identifies key patterns and features to ensure high accuracy in detection. It
is implemented as a scalable and user-friendly web application with browser
extension integration, providing real-time alerts to protect users from phishing
attacks. This innovative approach bridges advanced machine learning techniques
and practical cybersecurity solutions, aiming to create a safer online environment
for individuals and organizations.
